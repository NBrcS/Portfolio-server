            that can be solved only with a total clean on my actual pc, and i cannot do it now, so, is better wait to buy the laptop<br>

### Summary

  The motivation for doing this project was because I need a portfolio to show people how to use what I know in practice, so,
it was just to try to build api`s complete with Spring, Java and PostgreSql universe
like database

  This api is very simple, and can be used ( or only make sense ) in my own website that has yet to be developed.
in it, will return JSON`s with objects that contains the metadata of each project, course and certificate mine
